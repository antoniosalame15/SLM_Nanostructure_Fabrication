# SLM_Nanostructure_Fabrication
This project involves the development of Python scripts to control a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for fabricating precise nanostructures. Conducted during a 1.5-month internship, the focus was on automating the generation of patterns to improve experimental efficiency.
