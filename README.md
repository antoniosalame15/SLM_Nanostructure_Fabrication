# Fabrication of Nanostructures Using Spatial Light Modulator (SLM)

## Description
This project involves the development of Python scripts to control a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) for fabricating precise nanostructures. Conducted during a 1.5-month internship, the focus was on automating the generation of patterns to improve experimental efficiency.

## Skills & Tools
- Python scripting
- SLM control
- Optical physics
- Experimental automation

## Outcome
- Automated the SLM pattern generation
- Improved the precision and speed of nanostructure fabrication
- Provided a framework for future experiments

## Usage
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed
- Run `slm_control.py` to interface with the SLM
- Adjust pattern parameters as needed

## Optional Visuals
- Include photos or schematic diagrams of the SLM setup
